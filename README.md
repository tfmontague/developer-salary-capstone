## Abstract

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict developer salaries based on demographic and job-related factors. By leveraging salary surveys and machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover the main contributors to salary differences and offer insights that can help address pay disparities in the tech industry.

**Keywords**: machine learning, salary prediction, developer compensation, feature engineering, predictive modeling.

## Introduction

The technology industry plays a major role in shaping todayâ€™s world, and with it comes discussions around pay equity and diversity. As developers are key drivers of innovation, understanding what influences their salaries is essential. A recent survey highlighted pay gaps related to factors like gender, education, and experience, which can lead to significant differences in compensation. Through predictive analytics, we can delve into this data to understand how these factors influence developer salaries. The insights can help companies design fairer pay structures and provide developers with clarity around compensation drivers.

## Goals of This Project

This project analyzes developer salaries using machine learning, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to salary disparities.

- **Primary Goal**: Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts salaries based on demographic and professional data.
- **Secondary Goal**: Identify the most influential factors affecting salary disparities, such as education, gender, and experience.
- **Expected Outcome**: Create a reliable model that employers and developers can use to better understand salary benchmarks.

## Scope and Requirements

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict developer salaries using tools such as Python for data analysis, VS Code for development, GitHub for version control, and Jupyter Notebooks for exploration, training, and evaluation. A Shiny app provides a dynamic dashboard where users can input data and receive salary predictions, while Overleaf with LaTeX is used for the project report.

## Data Collection

This project uses data from the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Stack Overflow provides valuable real-world insights into developer roles, skills, and pay, while the BLS offers reliable, comprehensive salary data. Together, these sources offer a solid foundation for analyzing developer salaries.

### Limitations
This project focuses exclusively on developer salary data from 2023 and 2024, limiting the analysis to those two years. It does not include historical salary trends from earlier years, nor does it cover other tech-related roles outside of developer positions. These limitations may affect the broader applicability of the results.
